# End2EndDecoder
This is for end to end decoder for endoscopic imaging with out-of-focus noise. 
Note that this repository is not the finalized official version (as the paper is in preparation). 
Most of my research projects are stored in GitHub Enterprise (@github.mit.edu), so I moved this repository here.
